# NFL Football FujiNet netplay

Port of Mattel Intellivision NFL Football (©1978/79) to two-player FujiNet
netplay — the third port, following Baseball
(`~/Workspace/intv-baseball-experiment`) and Auto Racing
(`~/Workspace/fujinet-intv-auto-racing`).

Read these before changing anything:

- **`PORTING.md`** — the porting procedure (from the baseball repo, updated
  here with the Auto Racing port's lessons). §8 is the gated milestone
  sequence this repo follows; §9 is the release checklist. Every claim in it
  is measured, not assumed.
- **`spikes/NOTES.md`** — Football-specific recon, risks, and decisions.
  EXEC internals live in the baseball repo's `spikes/NOTES.md`; second-port
  deltas (vdispatch, injection recipe, rig hygiene) in the Auto Racing repo's.

Conventions:

- Netcode symbols keep Baseball's names (LS_/RS_/SES_/NET_/FT_/MB_*);
  game symbols are `FB_*`. Build artifacts are `build/football_*`.
- Netcode RAM starts at `$8080` — never below (STIC decode alias), and the
  build cfg declares cart RAM only to `$9BFF` (FujiNet mailbox owns `$9C00+`).
- `make rig` / `m4` / `peerleft` / `lobby` force the 127.0.0.1 server; never
  point automated runs at a production endpoint.
- Server: `server/intv_relay_server.py`, default port 9102 (Baseball owns
  9100, Auto Racing 9101 on a shared host). Echo latency probe: 9103.

Toolchain: as1600 / dis1600 / bin2rom; jzIntv at
`~/Workspace/jzintv-20200712-src/bin/jzintv` (headless: SDL dummy drivers);
fujinet-pc-rs232 dist at `~/Workspace/fujinet-pc-rs232/build/dist`.
