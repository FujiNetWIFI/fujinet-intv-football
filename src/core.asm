; Common assembly core: EXEC equates, RAM map, patched original ROM, hook.
; Build flags each top-level main_*.asm must define:
;   SPIKE_VIRT    1 = virtualize the $035D dispatch locally (null the real
;                 scan's table, replay ring events through live handlers) --
;                 Auto Racing's only input surface, so lag/det/replay need it
;   SPIKE_DELAY   virt-dispatch delay depth in game ticks (0 = same tick)
;   SPIKE_SCRIPT  1 = feed deterministic fuzz inputs instead of controllers
;   SPIKE_TRACE   1 = per-tick state checksum ring + park at TRACE_STOP
;   STALL_N       freeze the sim for N frames out of every 64 (0 = never)
