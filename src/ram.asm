; Netcode RAM layout -- PiRTO II cart RAM, 8-bit cells.
; Declare only $8000-$9BFF in the cfg: $9C00-$9FFF is the FujiNet mailbox,
; and claiming it breaks jzIntv's --fujinet peripheral (AND-ed bus reads).
;
; IMPORTANT -- $8000-$807F is a STIC decode alias and must stay UNUSED:
; the STIC only partially decodes its address, so its control registers
; also respond at $4000, $8000 and $C000 (jzIntv registers "STIC (alias)"
; at $8000-$803F, and $8040-$807F is the GROM visibility window).  A write
; to a cell there programs a real STIC register: e.g. a NET_READ byte
; count stored at $8032 set the top-border-extension bit ($0032), which
; painted border over BACKTAB row 0 and hid the VSTR/HOME scoreboard
; whenever netplay traffic flowed.  Nothing may live below $8080.
